Recently I wanted to turn a [100 must-visit spots](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/contents/contentsView.do?vcontsId=145437&menuSn=218) list from a South Korean tourism website into a Google My Maps map. However, they only offered a PDF with a fancy map or HTML accordion lists with that information. Either format would require a lot of manual work to extract the data and enter it by hand into Google My Maps.

So after some research I found out that you can import `.csv` files into Google My Maps. That's an easy job for an AI to turn an unstructured list into a structured CSV file.

I copied the list of places into a text file. They were formatted like this:

```txt
Seoul Capital Area
Seoul
N Seoul Tower
Seoul
Gwanghwamun Square / Cheonggye Plaza
```

After a bit of formatting the output became:

```md
## Seoul Capital Area

### Seoul
- N Seoul Tower
- Gwanghwamun Square / Cheonggye Plaza
```

Here's the prompt I used to turn this into a My Maps compatible CSV file:

```shell
I have a list of places in @LIST.md - your job is to export a list.csv file in a format compatible with Google My Maps. The file will be used for importing these places into Google My Maps.
```

You should get back a CSV file formatted like this:

```
Name,Description,Address
N Seoul Tower,Seoul,N Seoul Tower Seoul South Korea
Gwanghwamun Square / Cheonggye Plaza,Seoul,Gwanghwamun Square Seoul South Korea
```

Lastly, to import into Google My Maps:
1. Go to Google My Maps
1. Create a new map or open an existing one
1. Click _Import_ in a layer
1. Upload the `list.csv` file
1. Select _Address_ as the column to position placemarks
1. Select _Name_ as the column for marker titles

And that's it! Nothing really complicated, but a great time-saver when dealing with lots of places.
