In most cases a [Duplicati](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati) backup runs in the background without any interaction needed. However, if a backup fails, it's crucial to receive a notification. Duplicati has a couple of [built-in features](https://docs.duplicati.com/detailed-descriptions/sending-reports-via-email) to send reports but no native integration for Discord.

If you, like me, consolidate notifications for self-hosted services in a Discord server, this guide will show you how to integrate Duplicati's HTTP notifications with Discord's webhooks.

> [!NOTE]
> **Intended audience**
>
> This guide assumes that you have a Cloudflare account. If you don't want to use Cloudflare you'll have to fork the mentioned repository and adapt it to your deployment platform of choice.

## Set up a Cloudflare worker

I have created [duplicati-discord-cloudflare-worker](https://github.com/LekoArts/duplicati-discord-cloudflare-worker) which is a Cloudflare worker to proxy Duplicati's HTTP notifications to a Discord webhook URL. It "translates" the outgoing HTTP notifications into a format that Discord understands.

Since I don't want to host this proxy for you, you'll need to create your own worker. Cloudflare has a generous free tier so under normal circumstances this proxy worker will always be free.

Here's how you can set up your own worker:

1. Create a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) account
1. [Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/LekoArts/duplicati-discord-cloudflare-worker)

If everything goes smoothly you should end up with a deployed Cloudflare worker that has a URL similar to this one:

```shell
https://duplicati-discord-cloudflare-worker.your-name.workers.dev
```

## Create a Discord webhook URL

Inside your Discord server, select **"Edit Channel"** for the channel that should receive the notifications. Navigate to **"Integrations"**, select **"Webhooks"**, and open **"New Webhook"**.

Give the newly created webhook a name and select **"Copy Webhook URL"** to copy the webhook URL to your clipboard.

> [!WARNING]
> **A webhook URL should be kept secret**
>
> Make sure to keep the webhook URL secret. Anyone who has the URL can send messages to your server!

The URL will be in this format:

```text "12345/foobar123"
https://discord.com/api/webhooks/12345/foobar123
```

You'll need the `12345/foobar123` portion of the URL for the next step.

## Duplicati integration

Now it's time to tie everything together inside Duplicati.

1. Open your Duplicati web UI and select the **"Home**" tab
1. Inside **"Configuration"** select the **"Edit..."** button
1. Navigate to the **"Options"** tab
1. Inside **"Advanced options"**, select `send-http-json-urls` from the **Add advanced option** select dropdown
1. Add your Cloudflare worker URL together with the portion you copied from the Discord webhook URL to the `send-http-json-urls` text field:

    ```shell
    https://duplicati-discord-cloudflare-worker.your-name.workers.dev/12345/foobar123
    ```
1. Save your edit to the backup

You can repeat these steps for every Duplicati backup that you'd like to receive notifications for.

## Discord thread / forum channel support

If you want to send notifications to a [Discord thread](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ) or to a post inside a [forum channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ), you need to pass a `thread_id` to the Cloudflare worker. Here's how you can do that:

1. Navigate to the thread / forum post, right-click it, and choose **"Copy Link"**.

   It will be in the following format:

   ```shell "456"
   https://discord.com/channels/123/456
   ```

   The `456` is your `thread_id`.

1. Adjust the URL you're passing to the `send-http-json-urls` flag by adding `?thread_id=<your-thread-id>` to the end of it:

   ```text ins="?thread_id=456"
   https://duplicati-discord-cloudflare-worker.your-name.workers.dev/12345/foobar123?thread_id=456
   ```
