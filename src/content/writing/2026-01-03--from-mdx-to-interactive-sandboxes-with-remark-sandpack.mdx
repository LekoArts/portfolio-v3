If you have used [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) in the past you might also be familiar with [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/). It's a library to embed live coding environments into your documentation. Even the [React docs](https://react.dev/learn) use Sandpack!

I published a package called [remark-sandpack](https://github.com/LekoArts/remark-sandpack) to make authoring examples for it easier. Instead of writing JSX, you can use code blocks. Normally you'd author the Sandpack examples like this:

````mdx title="Using JSX"
<Sandpack
  template="react"
  files={{
    '/App.js': 'Code goes here',
  }}
/>
````

With `remark-sandpack` the individual files go into code blocks:

````mdx title="Using remark-sandpack"
<Sandpack template="react">

```js name=App.js
Code goes here
```

</Sandpack>
````

## Prerequisites

If you already installed and set up Sandpack with MDX, you can skip this section.

1. MDX set up in your project. You must be able to add remark plugins.
1. Follow the [install instructions](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/getting-started) to set up Sandpack in your project.

## Install remark-sandpack

Install `@lekoarts/remark-sandpack` to your project:

```shell
npm install @lekoarts/remark-sandpack
```

Afterwards, add it to your list of remark plugins. The exact details depend on your setup, but here are two examples:

```js title="Node.js" {1,8}
import remarkSandpack from '@lekoarts/remark-sandpack'
import { remark } from 'remark'
import remarkMdx from 'remark-mdx'
import { read } from 'to-vfile'

const file = await remark()
	.use(remarkMdx)
	.use(remarkSandpack)
	.process(await read('example.mdx'))

console.log(String(file))
```

```js title="Astro" {1,9}
import remarkSandpack from '@lekoarts/remark-sandpack'
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx'
import react from '@astrojs/react'
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [mdx(), react()],
	markdown: {
		remarkPlugins: [[remarkSandpack]],
	},
})
```

You can also pass a `componentName` option to customize the name of the components the remark plugin should look for. By default it's `Sandpack`. For example, if you authored a custom `<Playground>` component that wraps Sandpack, you can do this:

```js title="componentName option"
// Node.js
  .use(remarkSandpack, { componentName: ['Playground'] })

// Astro
  remarkPlugins: [[remarkSandpack, { componentName: ['Playground'] }]]
```

## Usage

You're now ready to author Sandpack examples by just using code blocks inside your `<Sandpack>` components!

As shown in the beginning, the basic usage looks like this:

````mdx title="Basic"
<Sandpack template="react">

```js name=App.js
Code goes here
```

</Sandpack>
````

You're **required** to provide a `name` attribute to the code block. Additionally, you can provide optional configuration (following Sandpack's [file format](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/getting-started/usage#file-format)):

- `hidden`
- `active`
- `readOnly`

Example:

````mdx title="Configuration"
```js name=filename.js active
console.log('Hello World')
```
````
