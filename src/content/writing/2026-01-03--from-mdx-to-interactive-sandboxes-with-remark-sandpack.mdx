If you have used [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) in the past, you might also be familiar with [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/). It's a library for embedding live coding environments into your documentation. Even React's official [docs](https://react.dev/learn) use Sandpack!

I published a package called [remark-sandpack](https://github.com/LekoArts/remark-sandpack) to make authoring examples easier. Instead of writing JSX by hand, you can use code blocks. Normally you'd author the Sandpack examples like this:

````mdx title="Using JSX"
<Sandpack
  template="react"
  files={{
    '/App.js': 'Code goes here',
  }}
/>
````

With `remark-sandpack`, the individual files go into code blocks:

````mdx title="Using remark-sandpack"
<Sandpack template="react">

```js name=App.js
Code goes here
```

</Sandpack>
````

## Prerequisites

If you've already installed and set up Sandpack with MDX, you can skip this section.

1. MDX set up in your project with support for remark plugins.
1. Follow the [install instructions](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/getting-started) to integrate Sandpack into your project.

## Install remark-sandpack

Install `@lekoarts/remark-sandpack` in your project:

```shell
npm install @lekoarts/remark-sandpack
```

Then add it to your list of remark plugins. The exact details depend on your setup, but here are two examples:

```js title="Node.js" {1,8}
import remarkSandpack from '@lekoarts/remark-sandpack'
import { remark } from 'remark'
import remarkMdx from 'remark-mdx'
import { read } from 'to-vfile'

const file = await remark()
	.use(remarkMdx)
	.use(remarkSandpack)
	.process(await read('example.mdx'))

console.log(String(file))
```

```js title="Astro" {1,9}
import remarkSandpack from '@lekoarts/remark-sandpack'
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx'
import react from '@astrojs/react'
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [mdx(), react()],
	markdown: {
		remarkPlugins: [[remarkSandpack]],
	},
})
```

You can also pass a `componentName` option to customize which component names the remark plugin looks for. By default, it's `Sandpack`. For example, if you've created a custom `<Playground>` component that wraps Sandpack, you can do this:

```js title="componentName option"
// Node.js
  .use(remarkSandpack, { componentName: ['Playground'] })

// Astro
  remarkPlugins: [[remarkSandpack, { componentName: ['Playground'] }]]
```

## Usage

You're now ready to author Sandpack examples by using code blocks inside your `<Sandpack>` components.

As shown in the introduction, the basic usage looks like this:

````mdx title="Basic"
<Sandpack template="react">

```js name=App.js
Code goes here
```

</Sandpack>
````

You're **required** to provide a `name` attribute on each code block. Additionally, you can provide optional configuration (following Sandpack's [file format](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/getting-started/usage#file-format)):

- `hidden` - Include the file but hide it in the file explorer
- `active` - Make this the intially active file
- `readOnly` - Prevent editing in the UI

File configuration example:

````mdx title="Configuration"
```js name=filename.js active
console.log('Hello World')
```
````
