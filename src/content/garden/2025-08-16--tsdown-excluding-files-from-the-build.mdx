[tsdown](https://tsdown.dev/) is a bundler powered by Rolldown that can bundle individual files or whole directories for you. If you're choosing a directory as your `entry` (e.g. `src` folder) you might bundle test files, too. They'll end up in your `dist` folder and shipped to npm.

So your tsdown configuration might look like this:

```ts title="tsdown.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'tsdown'

export default defineConfig([
  {
    entry: ['src'],
    platform: 'neutral',
    dts: true,
  },
])
```

The `entry` option supports [_glob patterns_](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/glob-patterns). You can use this feature to exclude test files from your `entry`.

In the example below any files that have `.test.` in their name or are in the `__tests__` folder will be excluded.

```ts title="tsdown.config.ts" ins="'!src/**/__tests__/**'" ins="'!src/**/*.test.*'"
import { defineConfig } from 'tsdown'

export default defineConfig([
  {
    entry: ['src', '!src/**/__tests__/**', '!src/**/*.test.*'],
    platform: 'neutral',
    dts: true,
  },
])
```

With `!` you can negate a pattern. If you're unsure how your glob pattern will affect the output, you can also try websites like [globster.xyz](https://globster.xyz/).
