In this article, you'll learn how to use [fzf-git](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-git.sh) to fuzzy search your local git repository.

Hereâ€™s what a branch search looks like:

![A screenshot of a terminal window. The command "gcos" was run and underneath it two entries in a list are shown: main and revamp-photos. These represent branch names. Divided with a horizontal ruler below these two items a vertical list of commits is shown. These commits correspond with the selected/highlighted branch.](./_img/fzf-git-gcos-example.png)

You can also use it to search through your files, tags, and more inside your CLI. The screenshot above shows a custom zsh function `gcos()` which uses `fzf-git` under the hood. You can also use `fzf-git` directly though.

## Installation

1. Install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
1. Install [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) for advanced syntax highlighting.
1. Locate your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file (typically in your `$HOME` directory). Download the `fzf-git.sh` file from [fzf-git](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-git.sh) to this directory or a subdirectory.
1. Source `fzf-git.sh` in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

    ```sh title=".zshrc"
    source "$HOME/fzf-git.sh"
    ```
1. Try out the keybindings defined in [fzf-git usage section](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-git.sh#usage). For example, <kbd>CTRL-G</kbd> <kbd>CTRL-B</kbd> for branches.

## Defining shortcuts

To get the `gcos()` function shown in the screenshot, define a shortcut like so:

```sh title=".zshrc"
# Fuzzy-search branches
gcos() {
  _fzf_git_branches --no-multi | xargs git checkout
}
```

You can check the `fzf-git.sh` script for a list of all available functions.
