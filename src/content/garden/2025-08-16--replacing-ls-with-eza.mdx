I've previously written about [Replacing ls with exa](/garden/replacing-ls-with-exa/) and I have used [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) for many years. But now, at the time of writing, exa is unmaintained. You should use the fork [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) instead.

eza describes itself similar to exa:

> eza is a modern alternative for the venerable file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.

The fork fixed some annoying bugs and added more features.

Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/blob/main/INSTALL.md) to install eza. I personally used the `cargo install` command as I have the Rust toolchain set up on my machine. Normally I'd use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) but the port would install the `rust` port, too, which I don't want (because then I have to Rust versions on my machine).

Don't forget to install the [completions](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/blob/main/INSTALL.md#completions).

Here' are the aliases I use:

```sh
## eza
alias ls="eza" # ls
alias ll='eza -lbF --git' # list, size, type, git
alias llm='eza -lbGd --git --sort=modified' # long list, modified date sort
alias la='eza -lbhHigUmuSa --time-style=long-iso --git --color-scale' # all list
alias lx='eza -lbhHigUmuSa@ --time-style=long-iso --git --color-scale' # all + extended list
alias lS='eza -1' # one column, just names
alias lt='eza --tree --level=2' # tree
```
